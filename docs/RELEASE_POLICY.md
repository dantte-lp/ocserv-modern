# ocserv-modern Release Policy

## Overview

ocserv-modern follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 for all releases. This document defines the release process, versioning strategy, support policy, and lifecycle management.

## Semantic Versioning

### Version Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- **MAJOR** version: Incompatible API changes, breaking protocol changes, or major architectural rewrites
- **MINOR** version: New features added in a backward-compatible manner
- **PATCH** version: Backward-compatible bug fixes and security patches

### Pre-release Labels

- **Alpha** (`X.Y.Z-alpha.N`): Early development, unstable, breaking changes expected
- **Beta** (`X.Y.Z-beta.N`): Feature-complete, undergoing testing, minor breaking changes possible
- **Release Candidate** (`X.Y.Z-rc.N`): Production-ready candidate, no new features, bug fixes only

### Examples

- `1.0.0` - First stable release
- `1.1.0` - New DTLS 1.3 support added
- `1.1.1` - Security patch for DTLS handshake
- `2.0.0` - Breaking change: minimum TLS version now 1.2
- `1.2.0-alpha.1` - Early alpha with experimental QUIC support
- `1.2.0-beta.2` - Second beta with QUIC support
- `1.2.0-rc.1` - Release candidate for 1.2.0

## Version Bump Guidelines

### MAJOR Version Bump

Trigger conditions (any of):
- API breaking changes requiring client updates
- Minimum TLS/DTLS version increase
- Configuration file format changes (not backward-compatible)
- Protocol changes incompatible with previous versions
- Removal of deprecated features
- Major architecture changes (e.g., multi-process to multi-threaded)

Example: Migrating from GnuTLS to wolfSSL native API (1.x → 2.0.0)

### MINOR Version Bump

Trigger conditions (any of):
- New features added (backward-compatible)
- New cipher suite support
- New authentication method
- Performance improvements without breaking changes
- New configuration options (with defaults maintaining backward compatibility)
- Deprecation warnings (feature removed in next MAJOR)

Example: Adding DTLS 1.3 support (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)

### PATCH Version Bump

Trigger conditions (any of):
- Security vulnerability fixes (CVE)
- Bug fixes (crashes, memory leaks, incorrect behavior)
- Documentation updates
- Performance regressions
- Build system fixes
- Dependency version updates (security only)

Example: Fixing TLS handshake timeout (1.1.0 → 1.1.1)

## Release Cadence

### Time-Based Releases

- **MINOR releases**: Every 4-6 months
- **PATCH releases**: As needed, typically 2-4 weeks for security issues
- **MAJOR releases**: No fixed schedule, driven by architectural needs

### Feature-Based Releases

A MINOR release may be triggered early if:
- Critical new feature requested by enterprise users
- Protocol standard update (e.g., new RFC)
- Major dependency update enabling new capabilities
