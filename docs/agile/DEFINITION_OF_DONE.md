- [ ] All TLS/DTLS code migrated
- [ ] OpenConnect clients can connect
- [ ] All authentication methods functional

- [ ] Security audit passed (0 critical, <3 high-severity)
- [ ] 100% Cisco Secure Client 5.x+ compatibility
- [ ] All platforms tested successfully
- [ ] No release-blocking bugs

**If gate fails**: Delay release, address issues

- ✅ Unit tests pass
- ✅ Code coverage ≥80%
- ✅ Static analysis clean (clang-tidy)
- ✅ Memory leak check (Valgrind)
- ✅ AddressSanitizer clean
- ✅ ThreadSanitizer clean
- ✅ Coding style check (clang-format)

### Manual Checks

The following require manual validation:

- 🔍 Code review approval
- 🔍 Integration testing
- 🔍 Security review

## Exceptions and Waivers

### Exception Process

If a DoD criterion cannot be met, an exception must be:

1. **Documented**: Why the criterion cannot be met
2. **Justified**: Impact assessment and rationale
3. **Approved**: By Tech Lead and Product Owner
4. **Tracked**: As technical debt with remediation plan
5. **Time-Boxed**: With clear deadline for resolution

### Exception Log

| Date | Item | Criterion Waived | Approver | Resolution Date |
|------|------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|
| [Date] | [Item] | [Criterion] | [Approver] | [Target] |

## Continuous Improvement

### DoD Review Schedule

- **After Each Sprint**: Minor adjustments based on retrospective
- **After Each Phase**: Review and update as needed
- **Major Review**: Every 3 months or at major milestones

### Process Feedback

Team members can suggest DoD improvements by:

1. Raising in sprint retrospectives
2. Creating improvement proposals
3. Discussing in team meetings
