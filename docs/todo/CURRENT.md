## Decision Log

Key decisions will be tracked here as the project progresses.

### Decision 001: wolfSSL Native API vs Compatibility Layer
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Decision**: Use wolfSSL native API, not OpenSSL compatibility layer
- **Rationale**: Better performance, smaller footprint, cleaner integration
- **Impact**: More migration work, but better long-term results

### Decision 002: Do Not Migrate IPC Layer
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Decision**: Keep protobuf-c for IPC, do not migrate to Cap'n Proto or nanopb
- **Rationale**: Not a bottleneck, adds risk without proven benefit
- **Impact**: Reduced scope, faster delivery

### Decision 003: External Security Audit Required
- **Date**: 2025-10-29
- **Decision**: Budget for external security audit ($50k-100k)
- **Rationale**: VPN server is security-critical, need independent validation
- **Impact**: Increased cost but better security assurance

## Research & Future Exploration

### ExpressVPN Lightway Protocol Investigation

**Priority**: MEDIUM (Research)
**Timeline**: Post v2.0.0 release
**Status**: ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred until after core wolfSSL migration

#### Background

ExpressVPN's **Lightway** is a modern VPN protocol built on wolfSSL, designed as a lightweight, fast, and secure alternative to legacy VPN protocols. It uses:
- **wolfSSL** for cryptographic operations (same as our project!)
- Modern cryptographic primitives
- Optimized for mobile and unreliable networks
- Open source implementation available

#### Resources

- **Core Library**: https://github.com/expressvpn/lightway-core
- **Rust Implementation**: https://github.com/expressvpn/lightway (reference with docs)
- **Documentation**: https://github.com/expressvpn/lightway/tree/main/docs

#### Investigation Tasks

- [ ] Review Lightway protocol specification
  - [ ] Understand protocol design and message flow
  - [ ] Analyze cryptographic choices and justification
  - [ ] Compare with OpenConnect/AnyConnect protocol

- [ ] Study lightway-core C implementation
  - [ ] Review wolfSSL integration patterns
  - [ ] Analyze error handling approaches
  - [ ] Study session management and resumption
  - [ ] Evaluate thread safety model

- [ ] Study Rust implementation and documentation
  - [ ] Read design documentation
  - [ ] Understand architectural decisions
  - [ ] Extract best practices applicable to ocserv-modern

- [ ] Evaluate integration opportunities
  - [ ] Could ocserv-modern support Lightway as alternative protocol?
  - [ ] Are there wolfSSL usage patterns we should adopt?
  - [ ] Can we reuse any abstraction layers?
  - [ ] Compatibility considerations with Cisco ecosystem

#### Key Questions to Answer

1. **Performance**: How does Lightway compare to OpenConnect protocol?
2. **Security**: What security advantages does Lightway offer?
3. **Compatibility**: Could Lightway coexist with AnyConnect protocol support?
4. **Code Reuse**: Can we reuse any Lightway components or patterns?
5. **wolfSSL Usage**: What can we learn from their wolfSSL integration?
6. **Mobile Optimization**: What mobile-specific optimizations does Lightway use?

#### Potential Outcomes

**Option A: Learn Best Practices**
- Adopt wolfSSL integration patterns
- Use similar error handling approaches
- Apply mobile optimization techniques
- Maintain AnyConnect protocol compatibility

**Option B: Dual Protocol Support**
- Add Lightway as optional alternative protocol
- Clients can choose OpenConnect or Lightway
- Requires significant additional development
- Market positioning: "Best of both worlds"

**Option C: Lightway-Inspired Enhancements**
- Enhance OpenConnect protocol with Lightway ideas
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Selective feature adoption

#### Dependencies

**Blocked By**:
- v2.0.0 release (wolfSSL migration must be complete and stable)
- Performance validation of wolfSSL migration
- Team capacity post-launch

**Prerequisites**:
- Completed wolfSSL integration experience
- Stable production deployment
- Community feedback on v2.0.0

#### Estimated Effort

**Research Phase**: 2-3 weeks
- Protocol analysis: 1 week
- Code review: 1 week
- Feasibility assessment: 1 week

**If Pursuing Integration**:
- Lightweight (pattern adoption): 2-4 weeks
- Medium (inspired enhancements): 8-12 weeks
- Full (dual protocol): 16-24 weeks

#### Decision Date

**No Earlier Than**: Q4 2026 (post v2.0.0 release)
**Review Trigger**: After v2.0.0 has been in production for 3+ months

#### Notes

- Lightway is GPLv2 licensed (same as wolfSSL 5.7.x and earlier)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Check Lightway's wolfSSL version requirements
  - May use older wolfSSL version with GPLv2 (not v5.8.2 with GPLv3)
- ExpressVPN actively maintains the project
- Growing community adoption
- Designed by security experts with VPN domain expertise
- Could provide valuable insights even if we don't adopt the protocol
